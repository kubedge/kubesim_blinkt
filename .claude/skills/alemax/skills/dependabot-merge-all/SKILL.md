name: dependabot-merge-all
description: Use when several Dependabot PRs are open against one repo. Merge several Dependabot PRs in sequence, re-rebasing each after the previous one lands — squash-merging one flips every other PR touching the same file to DIRTY (their diff used the now-changed line as context), so each needs its own `@dependabot rebase` round-trip. Same script as `/alemax:dependabot-merge`, run with `--all` or an ordered list; stops at the first PR that stops. Works from any repo with a GitHub remote.

compatibility: Requires `gh` (authenticated), git, and `uv`. Merges only with `--apply`.

## Wraps

`alemax dependabot` — no subcommands — flags only. Run it from the repo root as
`uv run --directory plugins/alemax alemax dependabot <subcommand> …`. `--help` documents every flag.

Exit codes, branching and the reasoning behind each rule are in spec `alemax-dependabot-skills`
and the module's own docstrings. This body carries what a session must decide, and what
to report — restating the code here is how the two drift.

## Steps

1. **Dry run:** `uv run --directory plugins/alemax alemax dependabot --all`
   (or the PR numbers in the order wanted) — confirm the list with the operator.
2. **Apply:** the same line with `--apply`. Each subsequent PR is rebased by the script after the
   previous merge; do not comment or poll by hand.
3. **Report** the summary block — which merged (sha), which stopped and why, which are untouched.
   On a stop the operator fixes the blocker and re-runs with the remaining numbers.

## Not for

- One PR → `/alemax:dependabot-merge <pr>`.
- PRs touching different files — they merge independently; batching adds nothing.
- Bumps the operator has not accepted — decide first, then batch.
